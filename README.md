teaching python &amp; examples

This is my attempt at teaching the basics of programming through python.
Contents:

# Variables
Learn what variables are, what local and global variables are.

# Functions
Learn what functions are, and how to use them with variables

# Classes
Learn what classes are, and how they encapsulate both functions and variables

# Data structures
How do you store things and work with things easily? Data structures!

# Loops
Sometimes you want to do the same thing multiple times. Or a different thing every single time. Loops!

# Recursion
Sometimes you can't do a loop for something. Hello recursion!

# Packages
The true magic of python is packages! This is where it gets interesting.
