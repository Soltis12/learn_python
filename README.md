# learn python
This is my attempt at teaching (very hands-on) the basics of programming through python.

I find a lot of tutorials drag on basic concepts, maybe for good reason, but why not just make it concise?

I have created various scripts which teach as you read them. The idea is you can download and run the scripts, but also
you can read the comments and understand how each script works.

You can play around with the results of each script, and build upon each level quickly - at least that's the plan!

Contents:
# Variables
Learn what variables are, what local and global variables are.

# Functions
Learn what functions are, and how to use them with variables

# Classes & Objects
Learn what classes are, and how they encapsulate both functions and variables

# Data structures
How do you store things and work with things easily? Data structures!

# Loops & Recursion
Sometimes you want to do the same thing multiple times. Or a different thing every single time. Loops!

# Packages
The true magic of python (and many other languages) is packages! 
Standing on the shoulders of giants.

# Challenges
I will add these over time.
