teaching python &amp; examples

This is my attempt at teaching the basics of programming through python.
Contents:

# Variables
Learn what variables are, what local and global variables are.

# Functions
Learn what functions are, and how to use them with variables

# Classes & Objects
Learn what classes are, and how they encapsulate both functions and variables

# Data structures
How do you store things and work with things easily? Data structures!

# Loops
Sometimes you want to do the same thing multiple times. Or a different thing every single time. Loops!

# Recursion
Sometimes you just need to do recursion. When? Whow knows.

# Packages
The true magic of python (and many other languages) is packages! 
Standing on the shoulders of giants.
